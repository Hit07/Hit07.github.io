I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/).
As a Research Assistant at the [HUMANS Lab](http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/code/) at USC, I collaborate
with [Prof. Emilio Ferrara](https://www.emilio.ferrara.name/) to analyze social media discourse and its effects on
public opinion.
My role involves architecting data pipelines, conducting advanced data analysis, and developing scalable solutions for
processing large-scale datasets.

Previously, as a Business Analyst at Genpact, India, I specialized in developing automated reporting solutions using
SAS.My focus was on enhancing data visualization capabilities and streamlining analytical processes to improve
operational efficiency.
My research interests center on improving efficiency and interpretability in machine learning systems.
