Hello!
I'm Hitesh from USC :)
Diving deep into data science and machine learning space.
Currently,pursuing MS in
Computer Science @[University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) with expected graduation in December 2025.
At [ATRI](https://atri.usc.edu/), I'm developing
participant tracking modules for clinical trials on EDC.
Previously, I worked on distributed ETL
pipelines @[HUMANS Lab](http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/code/)
under [Prof. Emilio Ferrara](https://www.emilio.ferrara.name/).
I engineered distributed data pipelines and applied
advanced NLP techniques to
analyze political discourse patterns across millions of social media posts.
My background spans ML/NLP, ETL pipeline development, and business analytics, with experience implementing enterprise
solutions that measurably improved reporting efficiency at [Genpact](https://www.genpact.com/).
