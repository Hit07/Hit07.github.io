Hello! I'm a Master's student at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) focusing on machine learning
and data systems. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Information Science and Engineering
at [Visvesvaraya Technological University](https://www.vtu.ac.in/).

Currently, I'm an Informatics R&D Intern at USC [Alzheimer's Therapeutic Research Institute](https://atri.usc.edu/),
where I build participant tracking features for clinical trials. I work in an agile, regulated research environment,
contributing to full-stack development and test automation.

In 2024, I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant in the [HUMANS Lab](http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/code/)
under [Prof. Emilio Ferrara](https://www.emilio.ferrara.name/), where I co-authored a CySoc 2025 paper on political
discourse during the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. In 2023, I worked at [Genpact](https://www.genpact.com/) as a Data
Analytics Trainee under Business Intelligence, developing Power BI dashboards and streamlining business reporting for
30,000+ employees across multiple business units.

## Personal Interests

Outside class, I enjoy mentoring peers, contributing to open-source projects, and serve as an Outreach Board Member
at [G.R.I.D.S](https://gridsusc.com/) USC to help grow the data science community.
I also love exploring new places and cultures, and I'm an avid fan of science fiction movies and TV shows.
In my downtime, you’ll often find me trekking or heading out on a spontaneous hike
