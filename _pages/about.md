I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), passionate
about leveraging data
science and machine learning to solve real-world challenges. As a Research Assistant at
the [HUMANS Lab](http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/code/) , I collaborate
with  [Prof. Emilio Ferrara](https://www.emilio.ferrara.name/) on cutting-edge research analyzing social media discourse
and its impact on public opinion.
My work focuses on developing scalable solutions for processing large-scale datasets, with expertise in natural language
processing, machine learning, and distributed computing. Previously, at Genpact,India, I specialized in developing
automated
reporting solutions and enhancing data visualization capabilities to drive operational efficiency.
