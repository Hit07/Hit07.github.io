I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). I'm working as a Research Assistant at the HUMANS Lab at USC, focusing on data analysis, web scraping, and processing large datasets. Previously, I worked as a Business Analyst at Genpact, India, where I optimized SQL queries, created automated reporting solutions using Power BI and DAX, and facilitated AWS Glue ETL pipelines for serverless data transformation.

My research interests are broadly in efficiency and interpretability in machine learning. I am currently working with [Prof. Emilio Ferrara](https://www.emilio.ferrara.name/) on analyzing social media discourse and its effects on public opinion. Previously, I worked on various other projects in data science and machine learning. You can find more details about my experience and skills in my [resume](/assets/pdf/Narayana_Hitesh.pdf).
