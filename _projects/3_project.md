## Python Minor Projects

This repo showcases a variety of projects and learning experiments I've undertaken to enhance my skills in Python and
other technologies. Each project represents a step towards mastering different tools and frameworks, reflecting my
journey in software development.

### Python Fundamentals
- Practiced core syntax, functions, and control flow each day to build a solid foundation in variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.
- Next, I explored object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Other deeper concepts like list comprehensions, lambda functions, and decorators were also explored.
- I also learned about error handling, file I/O, and working with external libraries.
